###Mulitnominal Logistic Regression
####Example
library(rattle.data)
# Loading the wine data
data(wine)
library(nnet)

#The dependent variable here is Type of wine
multinom.fit <- multinom(Type ~ Alcohol + Color, data = wine)
summary(multinom.fit)
#Each model/row conveys the effect of predictors on the probability of
#success in that category,
#in comparison to the reference category.

#The first row represents the coefficients for Type 2 wine in
#comparison to our baseline which is Type  1
#wine and the second row represents the coefficients for
#Type 3 wine in comparison to our baseline which is Type 1 wine.

#If the coefficent is postive it indicates for a one-unit
#increase in the variable there will be
#an increase in the log odds of being
#in that type vs the baseline

#If the coefficent is negative it indicates for a one-unit
#increase in the variable there will be
#an decrease in the log odds of being
#in that type vs the baseline
